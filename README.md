# supernote-templates

This repository includes a number of templates designed for eInk devices,
primarily the Supernote A6X2 (Nomad).

These templates are generated from Python to make it easier to experiment with
different layouts and grid sizes.

## Downloading

All generated files are uploaded to the [releases
page](https://github.com/vishnusuresh/supernote-templates/releases).

## Templates

I tend to write with the toolbars disabled, so these templates

### 4mm Dot Grid

This is very similar to the stock grid templates, but using larger dots. I
personally like being able to see the dots, and making them larger seemed to be
the best way.

### Day Free

Inspired by the Hobonichi Day Free pages - it's essentially a dashed grid with a
solid vertical line. This is a very flexible layout which can be used in many
different ways.

### Daily Planner

Inspired by daily pages in Hobonichi planners, this is very similar to the Day
Free layout with some additional features - there is a date in the upper left
and a mini task list in the upper right. This is a flexible layout which lets
you build your own workflow.

### Daily Planner (Manta)

The same layout as the Daily Planner, but updated for the resolution of the A5X2
Manta and using a 5mm grid rather than a 4mm grid.

## Building

The build environment for this can be automatically set up if you're using Nix.
### Nix Environment
- On Windows, run in wsl (Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS)
- Install Nix thus:
```
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh -s -- --no-daemon
```
- Open another shell and run:
```
nix develop --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes
```
- This launches a Nix shell (`nix-shell`) environment
- Within this environment, run:
  - Just Once
   ```
   poetry install
   ```
   - Then
   ```
   make all
   ```
----------
### Non-Nix Environment
If you are not using Nix, you need the following:

- GNU Make
- Python 3
- Poetry
- Inkscape
- (Optional) Reflex

```
# Build all templates
$ make all

# Start a watcher which will automatically build templates when changed (requires reflex)
$ make watch
```

## Contributing

If you have ideas for new template designs, feel free to file an issue or submit
a pull request. I can't promise everything will be accepted, but I'm happy to
consider most ideas.
